Connaught is one of the four ancient provinces of Ireland, with Ulster, Leinster, and Munster comprising the other three. Connaught contains the present-day counties of Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Galway, and Leitrim. Connaught, located on the midwestern coast of the island, relied heavily on agriculture for its business, and the Famine of the mid-nineteenth century especially affected this area.

Newcastle is located in County Down, which is part of present-day Northern Ireland. Newcastle remains a seaside resort town known for its scenery. The town lies at the foot of Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland's highest point, and its beaches and golf courses attract thousands of summer vistors.

The Belfast Ladies Relief Association for Connaught was an interdenominational group dedicated to providing for those left hungry and destitute by the potato famine in 1845. The Association was begun on January 1, 1847, by Rev. John Edgar, whose prior public work dealt with temperance issues. Its primary focus was raising money, although many of its members did involve themselves more personally in relief work. Their primary methods of funding involved door-to-door canvassing and the operation of a Bazaar of Ladies' Work in Belfast. Circulars with statistics and stories of the devastation were published to aid the ladies in their appeal.

Although food and clothing were at first the items most sought, the women had loftier goals: ""to improve, by industry, the temporal condition of the poor females of Connaught and their spiritual condition by the truth of the bible."" (from Luddy 22) Schools teaching needlework and knitting were established throughout Connaught.

Fernando Wood served nine intermittent terms in Congress, beginning in 1841, and three terms as Mayor of New York City. The riots that Martha writes about in this letter stem from rival gubernatorial and mayoral appointments to replace the New York City Street Commissioner.

Solon Robinson's ""Hot Corn"" vignettes of city life among the impoverished and immigrant communities were later collected in a book, entitled ""Hot Corn Stories,"" which must have been known to Martha and to Anne either in serial or book form .

The ""little Katy"" mentioned in the letter may not refer to a family member but rather to the title character of one of Robinson's stories. However, hsc0022 mentions a girl named Katy staying with the Leeds family .

Algernon's brother, Ernest Mervyn Evans, died on June 28 after being injured in a subway accident.

Joseph Morris wrote the letter from Dundale, the Morris family estate in Villanova. Now part of the university's campus, the mansion was erected in 1890 as a retreat from the city for Israel Morris's son Theodore (who had just attained the presidency of Morris & Wheeler, his father's iron company) and his many children. The building currently houses the development offices of Villanova University .

Underneath crest are the words ""Oesterreichischer Lloyd. Triest."" Large watermark depicting a crown and the words ""Imperial Century."" The city of Acre was captured by King Philip Augustus of France and King Richard the Lion-Hearted of England during the Third Crusade (1189-1192) . Bakshish, stemming from the Persian for ""to give,"" means to tip . The stories of Tabitha, Simon the Tanner, and Peter's vision are from Acts 9:26-10:15. Peter raised Tabitha (also called Dorcas), a charitable woman, from the dead in the town of Joppa. He stayed there at the home of Simon the Tanner (today the house is open for visitors), where he had his vision of animals trapped in a sheet, which the Lord bade him to eat. When he refused, protesting that the Lord had designated some of them unclean for consumption, the Lord replied, ""What God hath cleansed, make not thou common."" Following this vision, Peter visited a Gentile named Cornelius and widened the scope of Christian ministry (then practiced within Judaism, as it was considered unclean for a Jew to minister to a Gentile) to include those outside the Jewish faith.</p>
