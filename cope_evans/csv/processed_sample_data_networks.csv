Fairfield is the country home of Alfred Cope, father of Elizabeth Waln Cope, the bride ""Lilly"" mentioned in the letter. Fairfield was located on York Road near Olney Avenue. Elizabeth married Philip Cresson Garrett on May 18, 1865. (From Stokes' Stokes Cope Emlen Evans Genealogy, cht. 3 and p. 39.)

Federal Hill overlooks the city and harbor of Baltimore and is so named because of the celebrations held there in 1788 when Maryland ratified the Federal Constitution. (From Miller's Baltimore Transitions: Views of an American City in Flux, p. 16.)
